# Health-Inequality in UK by Regions
# through Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper

Abstract

Whether in the pre-covid period or post-covid, public health has been one of the main societal concern, especially the issue of health inequality. This work explores health inequality in UK at region level by applying topological data analysis ball mapper algorithm. Focusing on the data in 2021 from UK census, the new method proves its advantage in detecting health inequalities and the ability in finding correlation between health inequalities and explanatory variables. The analysis finds health inequalities in education level, income level and employment status.
