# Health-Inequality in UK by Regions
# through Map Visualization and Machine Learning

Abstract

Whether in the pre-covid period or post-covid, public health has been one of the main societal concern, especially the issue of health inequality. This work explores health inequality in UK at region level by map visualization and machine learning models. Focusing on the data in 2021 from UK census, it designs a new index for representing health status and generalizes this idea to other demographic and socio-economic factors from census data. By means of machine learning tools, correlation between health inequality and other factors detected from map visualization is tested and validated.
